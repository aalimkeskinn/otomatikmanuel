Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// The file was missing a closing curly brace for the handleAutoPlacement function and a closing curly brace for the class loop.
// I've added them in the appropriate places:

// After the class loop:
    }

// After handleAutoPlacement function:
  };

// The rest of the file was properly closed with all required brackets.
```

The file now has proper bracket closure. I've only added the missing closing curly braces - no characters were removed and all other content remains exactly the same.
